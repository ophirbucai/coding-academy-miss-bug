# Bug ðŸª²

A project to monitor bugs using a simple project using MERN stack and NPM workspaces for CI/CD.

## Usage

1. Begin by running `npm install` to install the necessary client and server packages, along with the dev dependencies specified in the root `package.json`. These dependencies are crucial for executing parallel scripts during development.

2. Execute `npm run dev`. This script triggers all scripts listed in the root directory using the CLI command `run-p`, simultaneously running the scripts prefixed with `dev:*`.

3. To deploy the application, utilize `npm run start`. This command will trigger the `predeploy` script, initializing the client build script. Upon completion, static files will be generated in the `server/public` directory.
